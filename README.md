# <img src="public/assets/icon_16.png" alt="icon"> Tab Modifier

Take control of your tabs.

## Features

* Rename tab
* Change tab icon
* Pin tab
* Prevent tab closing
* Unique tab
* Mute tab

Quick rename can be done by right-clicking anywhere in the page and click on "Rename Tab".

## Why?

I needed a quick UI element in Chrome to know the environment of the tab, as a Web developer I often use multiple versions of the same website: local, pre-production and production.

Not easy to find the appropriate tab when you have multiple tabs called "My awesome website".

I created Tab Modifier to add prefixes to website titles with a specific match.

* [DEV] My awesome website: `.local.domain.com`
* [PREPROD] My awesome website: `.preprod.domain.com`
* [PROD] My awesome website: `.domain.com`

After that, I have added more features like "auto-pin", custom favicons and more.

## Focused scope

Tab Modifier is based on user *rules* and act on the tab URL that matches the first seen rule.

Aware of that, there is no reason to include a feature that is not "rule-based". Prefer to install specific extensions.

## Installation

Install from the **[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hcbgadmbdkiilgpifjgcakjehmafcjai/)**.

Also available for **[Opera Browser](https://addons.opera.com/fr/extensions/details/tab-modifier/)**.

Not available for **Firefox**, refer to [#46](https://github.com/FuryBee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/46).

## Usage

* Click on the Tab Modifier icon <img src="public/assets/icon_16.png" alt="icon"> to open Popup or Right-Click then Options.
* Create your tab rules.
* Try & enjoy!

## Known issues

### Local icon path doesn't work

Related issue: [#5](https://github.com/furybee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/5)

Due to browser security restrictions, this path won't work: `file://<path>/icon.png`.
Your icon will not be shown by Chrome.

Alternatively, you can upload your icon somewhere like [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/) and paste the direct link in your rule.

Another solution consists in transform your image in the [Data URI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme). Go to [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/image-to-datauri) and paste the given output (the long text) in the icon input on your rule.

### Chrome system pages `chrome://`

Related issues: [#11](https://github.com/furybee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/11), [#14](https://github.com/furybee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/14)

Pages that start with `chrome://` URL are protected. No content script can be injected then Tab Modifier will not work on these pages.

### Local files `file:///`

Related issue: [#13](https://github.com/furybee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/13)

By default, extensions don't have access to local files. You have to opt-in "Allow access to file URLs" from `chrome://extensions/?id=hcbgadmbdkiilgpifjgcakjehmafcjai`.

### Protected action is not triggered

Related issue: [#95](https://github.com/furybee/chrome-tab-modifier/issues/95)

Since Chrome 90, the JS event that triggers a refresh or a closure has been reworked. See related issue.
