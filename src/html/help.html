        <h2 class="md-headline">Concept</h2>

        <p>Take control of your browser tabs! With this extension you are able to change some behaviors on any website.</p>

        <p>All of your data are stored on your computer, I don't have any access to it.</p>

        <md-divider></md-divider>

        <h2 class="md-headline">What behaviors?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>You can <strong>rename</strong> a tab.</li>
            <li>You can set a new <strong>favicon</strong>.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>pin</strong> a website without effort.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>protect</strong> some websites from accidental closure with a confirm box.</li>
            <li>You can avoid duplicate tabs by setting up the <strong>unique</strong> property.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>mute</strong> the sound of any websites before they can play it (you have to enable this: <i>chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting</i>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            And the icing on the cake... Combine all of them!
        </p>

        <md-divider></md-divider>

        <h2 class="md-headline">How?</h2>

        <p>You have to create a record called a "<strong>Tab Rule</strong>".</p>

        <p>A <strong>Tab Rule</strong> has:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a <strong>name</strong>, used for you</li>
            <li>a <strong>detection</strong> type, either "Starts with", "Contains", "Ends with" or "RegExp"</li>
            <li>a <strong>URL fragment</strong>, used by the extension to detect the website you want to apply actions (i.e. behaviors), enter a regular expression if you have selected the "RegExp" detection type</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After filling these info, you can now select some actions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>the new <strong>title</strong> for the website, you can inject variables like <code>{title}</code> as <code>title</code> is a valid CSS selector parsed with <code>document.querySelector()</code></li>
            <li>the new <strong>icon</strong>, select one or set a valid image URL</li>
            <li>the <strong>pinned</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li>
            <li>the <strong>protected</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li>
            <li>the <strong>unique</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li>
            <li>the <strong>muted</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li>
            <li>the <strong>URL matcher</strong> to identify some URL parts and use them inside the title (advanced usage), enter a regular expression like <code>q=([^&]+)</code> and use <code>$1</code> in <strong>title</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can now go to the <a class="md-primary" href="#/">Tab Rules</a> section and create your first rule...</p>

        <p><i>Important: after creating or editing a rule, refresh the tab(s) to view the changes.</i></p>
        <p><i>Important (2): the order of your rules is important, the first match is used. You can reorder your rules anyway.</i></p>

        <md-divider></md-divider>

        <h2 class="md-headline">"URL fragment"? Meh?</h2>

        <p>In case you don't still understand what's going on here...</p>

        <p>The <strong>URL fragment</strong> value is the key for the extension. Let's see 2 examples.</p>

        <h3>First example</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I use GMail everyday and this tab is so important, I'm so mad when I accidentally close it and after few hours of working I can see that I have many GMail tabs opened, what a mess!</p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I create a new Table Rule called "The GMail hell" with the URL fragment "<strong>mail.google.com</strong>". I enable "Protected" and "Unique" and I save it. Closing all GMail tabs and reopen a new one, all done!</p>

        <p>The extension knows when to apply my actions because the GMail URL <strong>contains</strong> "mail.google.com".</p>

        <h3>Second example</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I'm usually having more than 20 tabs opened in my browser, I'm losing so much space! OK, what about pin them all? But I'm too lazy to do a right click on each tab.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I create a new Table Rule called "Pin them all" with the URL fragment "<strong>http</strong>" (because almost all website URLs <strong>contain</strong> the word "http"). I enable "Pin" and I save it. Closing the browser and reopen it, all tabs are now pinned!</p>

        <p>I hope you now understand how the <strong>URL fragment</strong> value works.</p>
