				<h2 class="card-title">üìã Tab Rules</h2>

				<p>You have to create a "tab rule". A tab rule has:</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Name</h3>
				<p>This name is used for you, just to find your rule among others.</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Detection</h3>
				<p>
					Choices are either "Starts with", "Contains", "Exact", "Ends with" or "RegExp". The
					extension must know how to apply your rule depending on the detection you need. You may
					need to catch a word inside the URL so you will select "Contains" or catch only PNG files
					so you will select "Ends with", etc. Most of the time, "Contains" does what you want, this
					is the default selected detection.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">URL fragment</h3>
				<p>
					This is the key of your rule. It will determine if your rule will be applied or not. For
					example, to catch GitHub repositories, you can set your rule with "Contains" detection and
					"github.com" URL fragment. Another solution could be to set "Starts with" detection and
					"https://github.com". Try any combination to achieve what you want.
				</p>
				<p class="text-accent">
					After defining the core of your rule you can select some actions listed below.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Title</h3>
				<p>This action will rewrite the website title.</p>
				<p>
					Another advanced usage can be used with the title, you can inject some parts of the URL
					with the dollar syntax. This feature is linked to the "URL matcher" action, see
					afterwards. Use $0, $1, etc. depending on your regular expression defined in "URL
					matcher".
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can scan the URL, you can also scan the title and inject some parts of it with the
					"at (@)" syntax. This feature is linked to the "Title matcher" action, see afterwards. Use
					@0, @1, etc. depending on your regular expression defined in "Title matcher".
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Icon</h3>
				<p>This action will replace the website (fav)icon.</p>
				<p>You can select an icon provided by the extension.</p>
				<p>
					Otherwise, you can define an icon URL in the input like
					"https://example.com/favicon.ico".
				</p>
				<p>For local icons from your computer, you have multiple options:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc ml-3">
					<li><strong>Paste directly</strong>: Copy an image (screenshot, file, etc.) and paste it directly into the "Custom Icon" field - it will be automatically converted to base64!</li>
					<li>Upload your icon somewhere like imgur.com and paste the direct link</li>
					<li>Use a service to convert your icon to Data URI format manually</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Group</h3>
				<p>This action will move your tab to a group.</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Pinned</h3>
				<p>This action will pin the tab.</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Protected</h3>
				<p>This action will ask you before refreshing or closing the tab.</p>
				<p>
					Note: Require sticky activation for the dialog to be displayed. In other words, the
					browser will only show the dialog box if the frame or any embedded frame receives a user
					gesture or user interaction. If you have never interacted with the page, the dialog will
					not be displayed.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Unique</h3>
				<p>
					This action will automatically close duplicate tabs. Besides the extension will not focus
					the original tab after closing the duplicate one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scenario: create a rule based on your email service with unique action. Open your email,
					open another tab with the same email, the last one will be closed.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Muted</h3>
				<p>This action will prevent the tab from playing sounds.</p>
				<p>
					To work, this feature requires that you enable this flag:
					chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting then restart your browser.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">Title matcher</h3>
				<p>
					An advanced usage, enter a regular expression to identify some title parts and use them
					inside the title itself, this is useful to reorder words or exclude some parts of the
					title, like [a-z]*@example.com and use @0 in the title input to inject the variable.
				</p>

				<h3 class="font-bold">URL matcher</h3>
				<p>
					An advanced usage, enter a regular expression to identify some URL parts and use them
					inside the title, like q=([^&]+) and use $0 in the title input to inject the variable.
				</p>

				<h2 class="card-title">üìù Additional notes</h2>

				<p>After creating or editing a rule, refresh the tab(s) to apply the changes.</p>
				<p>
					The order of your rules is important, if an URL triggers more than one rule, the first one
					will be applied. You can reorder your rules anyway.
				</p>
				<p>Some interesting tab rules are listed here for inspiration purposes.</p>
